# #5. Delete Node in a Linked List

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Python**
```python
def deleteNode(self, node):
    node.val = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next
```

**CPP**
```cpp
void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
    *node = *node->next;
}
```
