# #2. Long Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Python**
```python
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    nums = set(nums)
    best = 0

    for x in nums:
        if x-1 not in nums:
            y = x+1
            count = 1
            
            while y in nums:
                y+=1
                count+=1
            best = max(best, count)

    return best
```
